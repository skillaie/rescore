## Educational Background: 15/25

**Score:** 15 points (Master's in relevant field)

**Evidence:** 
> "Master of Science, Biology, State University | 2020 – 2022"
> "Bachelor of Science, Biology, Community College → State University (Transfer) | 2016 – 2020"

Master's degree in Biology is relevant but not specialized (e.g., not Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, or Computational Biology). No PhD.

---

## Research Experience: 15/30

**Score:** 15 points (Graduate research only)

**Evidence:**
> "Research Technician II, University Medical Center | 2022 – Present"
> "Graduate Research Assistant, State University | 2020 – 2022"

- Current role is technical support, not independent research
- Graduate research was completed but thesis topic ("Expression patterns of inflammatory markers in mouse tissue") suggests standard graduate-level work
- No postdoctoral experience
- No evidence of independent project leadership
- No funding secured

Note: The Research Technician role, while valuable, is primarily support-focused ("Maintain cell culture facility and support 3 research labs", "Assist graduate students with experimental protocols").

---

## Publication Record: 5/20

**Score:** 5 points (1 peer-reviewed publication)

**Evidence:**
> "Smith A, Williams B, Johnson M, et al. (2023) 'Inflammatory markers in tissue repair.' Journal of Regional Biology. Contributing author."

Single publication as contributing (not first) author in a regional journal. No first-author publications. No preprints mentioned.

---

## Technical Skills Alignment: 5/15

**Score:** 5 points (Partial match - 1 required technique)

**Evidence:**
> "Cell culture (mammalian), Western blot, IHC, IF, basic microscopy, PCR, gel electrophoresis"
> "Microsoft Office, basic R, ImageJ"

Skills are standard laboratory techniques but lack the high-value specialized methods:
- ✗ No CRISPR/gene editing
- ✗ No single-cell sequencing
- ✗ No computational biology/bioinformatics (only "basic R")
- ✓ Basic microscopy (partial match)
- ✗ No protein biochemistry beyond Western blot
- ✓ Some animal model experience implied by IACUC certification

"In progress: Bioinformatics Course - Coursera" shows initiative but not yet completed.

---

## Mission Alignment & Collaboration: 2/10

**Score:** 2 points

**Evidence:**
> No explicit evidence of open science contributions
> No formal mentorship role documented
> "Assist graduate students with experimental protocols" - informal collaboration only

Limited evidence of alignment with open/inclusive science mission. No community engagement or outreach mentioned.

## Total Score: 42/100

## Qualification Tier: NOT QUALIFIED

(Below 50 points - Archive for future openings)

---

## Key Strengths

1. **Solid foundational skills** - Competent in essential lab techniques (cell culture, Western blot, IHC) that form the basis for more advanced work.

2. **Growth mindset** - Currently pursuing additional bioinformatics training on own initiative. IACUC certification shows willingness to expand capabilities.

3. **Reliable team contributor** - Current role supporting multiple labs suggests dependability and ability to work in collaborative environment.

---

## Potential Concerns

1. **Limited independent research experience** - No evidence of designing or leading research projects. Current role is primarily technical support.

2. **Minimal publication record** - Single contributing-author publication in regional journal suggests limited research productivity to date.

3. **Skills gap for biomedical research** - Lacks the specialized techniques (single-cell, CRISPR, computational methods) increasingly central to modern biomedical research.

---

## Recommendation

**Not recommended for current research positions.** Mr. Johnson's profile suggests an early-career professional still building foundational experience.

**Alternative considerations:**
- May be suitable for Research Technician or Lab Manager positions if those become available
- Could be reconsidered in 2-3 years if they complete computational training and gain more independent research experience
- If the organization has training/development programs for promising early-career scientists, candidate shows initiative that could be cultivated

**Archive for:** Entry-level technical positions, future openings after additional experience gained.
