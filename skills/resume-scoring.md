# Scientific Resume Scoring Skill

## Overview
This skill defines how to evaluate and score scientific resumes for a biomedical research organization.

## Scoring Rubric (100 points total)

### 1. Educational Background (25 points max)

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| PhD in directly relevant field (biology, biochemistry, biomedical sciences, etc.) | 25 |
| PhD in related field (chemistry, physics, computational biology, etc.) | 20 |
| MD or MD/PhD | 25 |
| Master's in relevant field | 15 |
| Bachelor's in relevant field with significant research experience | 10 |
| Degree from recognized research institution | +2 bonus |

### 2. Research Experience (30 points max)

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| 5+ years post-doctoral/independent research | 30 |
| 3-5 years post-doctoral research | 25 |
| 1-3 years post-doctoral research | 20 |
| Graduate research only | 15 |
| Industry R&D experience in biomedical field | +5 bonus |

**Experience Quality Modifiers:**
- Led independent research projects: +3
- Secured research funding (grants, fellowships): +3
- Interdisciplinary collaboration demonstrated: +2

### 3. Publication Record (20 points max)

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| 10+ peer-reviewed publications | 20 |
| 5-9 peer-reviewed publications | 15 |
| 2-4 peer-reviewed publications | 10 |
| 1 peer-reviewed publication | 5 |
| First/corresponding author on high-impact papers | +3 bonus |
| Preprints demonstrating current work | +1 bonus |

### 4. Technical Skills Alignment (15 points max)

Score based on relevance to position requirements:

| Alignment | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Strong match (4+ required techniques/methods) | 15 |
| Good match (2-3 required techniques/methods) | 10 |
| Partial match (1 required technique/method) | 5 |
| Transferable skills only | 3 |

**High-Value Skills for Biomedical Research:**
- CRISPR/gene editing technologies
- Single-cell sequencing/analysis
- Computational biology/bioinformatics
- Microscopy (confocal, electron, super-resolution)
- Protein biochemistry
- Animal model experience
- Clinical research experience

### 5. Mission Alignment & Collaboration (10 points max)

Evidence of alignment with open science and inclusive research:

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Open science contributions (open-source tools, public datasets) | 3 |
| Mentorship/teaching experience | 3 |
| Collaborative research (multi-institutional projects) | 2 |
| Community engagement (science communication, outreach) | 2 |

## Qualification Tiers

| Score Range | Tier | Action |
|-------------|------|--------|
| 80-100+ | **Highly Qualified** | Priority review, fast-track |
| 65-79 | **Qualified** | Standard review process |
| 50-64 | **Potentially Qualified** | Review if pool is limited |
| Below 50 | **Not Qualified** | Archive for future openings |

## Scoring Instructions

1. Read the entire resume before scoring
2. Score each category independently
3. Apply bonus points where criteria are met
4. Document evidence for each score (quote from resume)
5. Calculate total and assign tier
6. Note any exceptional qualities not captured by rubric

## Example Scoring Output

```

- 4 years postdoc at NIH (25 pts)
- Led independent project (+3 pts)
- Evidence: "Postdoctoral Fellow, NIH/NINDS, 2019-2023; PI on R21 supplement"

### Publication Record: 18/20
- 7 peer-reviewed publications (15 pts)
- First author on 3 papers (+3 pts)
- Evidence: "Publications" section lists 7 papers, 3 as first author

### Technical Skills: 13/15
- Strong match: CRISPR, single-cell RNA-seq, computational analysis, mouse models
- Evidence: "Expertise" section and methods in publications

### Mission Alignment: 7/10
- Open data sharing (+3 pts)
- Graduate student mentorship (+3 pts)
- Science Twitter engagement (+1 pt)
- Evidence: "Deposited all datasets to GEO", "Mentored 3 rotation students"

**TOTAL: 88/100 - HIGHLY QUALIFIED**
```

## Red Flags to Note

- Gaps in timeline without explanation
- Claims that cannot be verified
- Mismatch between stated skills and publication record
- No evidence of collaboration or teamwork
- Retracted publications

## Bias Mitigation Checklist

Before finalizing score, verify:
- [ ] Scoring based only on stated qualifications
- [ ] International credentials evaluated fairly
- [ ] Non-traditional career paths considered
- [ ] Part-time or career-break periods not penalized unfairly
- [ ] Scores consistent with other similar candidates
